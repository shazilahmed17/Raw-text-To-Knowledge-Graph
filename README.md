# Raw-text-To-Knowledge-Graph
A solution for converting information in raw, generic text documents to structured Knowledge-Graph triplets

## Description

This is a research based project aimed at exploring and providing a viable solution for converting text documents directly to knowledge graphs. 

**Knowledge Graphs** are a more structured and organized way of storing information in the form of entities(people, places, things etc) and the relationship between them. They are a way to store data with a semantic meaning attached to it, and in the modern age of Artificial Intelligence this is crucial as these knowledge graphs would serve as a more viable option for storing data at the backend, especially for applications that involve recommender systems or questions answering.

The **Structure** of a knowledge graph involves a backend storage in the form of a **graph**, which has **nodes** representing **entites** and **edges** between them representing **relationships** and semantic meaning. 

The fundamental building block is a **triplet**, which comprises of a **subject**, **predicate** and an **object**. Subjects and Objects act as entities while the predicate describes the relationship between them.

This project was aimed at finding a way of extracting useful information from raw, unstructured text documents and converting it to triplets in order to generate a knowledge graph. Our proposed approach revolves around various **Natural Langugae Processing** techniques such as **Extractive Text Summarization**, **Coreference Resolution**, **Named Entity Recognition**, **Part of Speech Tagging** and much more.
